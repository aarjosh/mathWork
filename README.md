# mathWork
This is a repository for doing math with different codes of python.  

# Triangles.py
 The first code I have written is triangles.py. This code can calculate all sides of the right angle triangles when two sides are given. The third side must be labeled 0. Also remember that the hypotenuse must be bigger than all the other sides.

# Hypotenuse.py
The second code that I have written is hypotenuse.py. This code can find either the hypotenuse or one side length. To find one side length you have to give the shorter side length and the hypotenuse length. Also remember that the hypotenuse must be bigger than all the other sides.

# Palindrome.py
The third code that I have written is palindrome.py. This code can find if your word or number is a palindrome or not. All you have to do is enter the word or number that you want to check.

# Area sq.rec.py
The fourth code that I have written is area sq.rec.py. This code can find the length of your square or rectangle. 
All you have to do is enter the length and the width.

# Circumference.py
The fifth code that I have written is circumference.py. This code can find the circumference of a circle.
All you have to do is enter the radius.

# Area circle.py
The sixth code that I have written is area circle.py. This code can find the area of a circle.
All you have to do is enter the radius.

# Square root.py
The seventh code that I have written is square root.py. This code can find the square root of any number that you give. All you have to do is enter the number that you want a square root of. 

# Square.py
The eighth code that I have written is square.py. This code can find the square of any number that you give. All you have to do is enter the number that you want a square of.

# Calculator.py
The ninth code that I have written is calculator.py. This code can add and subract as many numbers as you want. All you have to do is enter the number that you want to add or subtract.

# Hangman.py
The tenth code that I have written is hangman.py. This code is a game and it is like hangman but without the picture. All you have to do it enter the letters and the computer will see if it is right or wrong.
