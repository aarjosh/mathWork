This is a repo for doing math with python. 

# Triangles.py
 The first code I have written is triangles.py. This code can calculate all sides of the right angle triangles when two sides are given. The third side must be labeled 0. Also remember that the hypotenuse must be bigger than all the other sides. 

# hypotenuse.py
The second code that I have written is hypotenuse.py. This can find either the hypotenuse or one side length. To find one side length you have to give the shorter side length and the hypotenuse length. 

# palindrome.py
The third code that I have written is palindrome.py. This can find if your word or number is a palindrome or not. All you have to do is enter the word or number that you want to check.
